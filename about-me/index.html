            <h2>Hi 👋🏽, I'm Dawud and a <br>Frontend Web Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Life comes with a lot more <b>challenges</b> to face especially when you are trying to chase your <b>Dreams!</b> ⏾.
                Everyone has his own ambition or what he/she really want to become in life, and before making that we have 
                to become more consistent to gain what are required for that field. It is right, everyone you see in this world 🌐
                that reach a certain level or <b>career!</b> 🏆, he/she didn't just wake up from sleep ⏾ and just found themselves their ⬆️. 
                Whatever they've become there's a time in their life were they fight chasing success, their <b><i>dreams!</i></b> ⏾, 
                They were once learners, faced different <b>challenges & difficulties</b> just to make their <b>dreams!</b> ⏾ become 
                true, so once you know what you <b>love!</b> ❤️ and want to become then there's no any time ⏲ left to waste.
                <br><br>
                In the past 3 years I was living blindly and don't know what I want or want to become, I was just manipulating between different 
                things and say that I want to be that without even understanding It's basic knowledge. But what I surely know is since I was in 
                primary, when I go to my aunty's house (Elder sister to my mother) for holiday, there are 2 of my brothers there and they both 
                had a laptop, they use to play football games and they give me to play GTA and other car games, so even when I get back home I 
                use to take my dad's and keep exploring it 💻. 
                <br><br>
                One day I was given a gift for a laptop and I start learning small basic stuff, and after some couple of days I went to my aunty's house 
                (Younger sister to my mother) to show especially my mate (Al'amin) my new laptop, then later I see him typing some weird things 
                that I cant quite understand on his laptop and asked him <b>what is this?</b>, he said it's <b>coding!</b>, then I asked him again
                <b>what is coding?</b>, then he explained me a little bit about programming in general and after that I transfer the <b>IDE (VS Code)</b> 
                and other tools like <b>Git</b> Installers on my external drive with some Tutorials of <b>HTML, CSS and PHP</b>. When I get home 
                I install the IDE and then I don't know what to do next, so I play the PHP tutorial and got to know that isn't what I suppose to 
                start learning and I get to the HTML videos and found it very useful and explained <b>what's a web, how does it works, 
                HTTP + S (encryption), DOM and lot more</b>.
                <br><br>
                That HTML video was made by <b>Mosh Hamedani</b>, a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b> that quit and focus on helping developers gain 
                <b>skills</b> and become <b>job ready</b> for companies, he's the best tech educator I never seen and he's guides are absolutely straightforward 
                and his videos are worth than any tech educator to me up to now, He definitely might not know me in any way but I will really like to meet 
                with him <b>eyes to eyes</b> one day 😃.
                <br><br>
                Most of the skills and knowledge about tech I know now are because of him, and I will keep learning to become ready for jobs and 
                continue to recommend him as always, I really want to see myself one day in a group or team of developers working on 
                different projects and keep learning from each other. I cant wait to see that day in my life 😍.
                <br><br>
                Finally I want to convince developers, those who starts learning how to code like me and those that want to start for either 
                Web development or any part of programming, <b>You can do it, don't let anyone hold you back and dont care about what people think 
                about you especially those that are not close to you once you know what you are doing!. and funny 😄 but true thing'AI is not gonna take your 
                job, If you know how to use it as a <i>Developer</i>'</b>. What I experienced is everyone that has ambition and the time that 
                he/she was chasing it, must be <b>misunderstood!</b>😇.
